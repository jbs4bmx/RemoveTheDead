## Description
A BepInEx mod for Escape From Tarkov via the modding framework, SPT-AKI (aka, SPTarkov, Single Player Tarkov, SPT, AKI, etc.). This allows you to set a radius and time interval in which dead bots will be removed from the map. The aim of this mod is to boost performance and increase in-game fps by reducing the number of objects (in this case, dead bots) being processed by the CPU.
